</div>

**Technologies**: Python, Time Series, Statistical Modeling, Business Intelligence

Built from scratch with full end to end ownership: model architecture, development, MLOps, data engineering, project management, stakeholder management. Served as technical lead. Not just a forecasting system, but **established time series best practices that became the foundation for the organization's approach**.

**Impact**: Team later took ownership and evolved it. **Used to this day for global financial planning**.


## Equipment Spare Parts Allocation

</div>

**Technologies**: Python, Optimization, Machine Learning, Data Engineering

Initiated and built with full end to end ownership: model architecture, development, MLOps, data engineering, project management, stakeholder management. Served as technical lead working with less senior colleagues.

**Impact**: Became a driving force for operational improvements **across global operations with massive opportunity**. Still live and used daily across the organization.

**Full circle moment**: Later returned as independent contractor for various improvements, proud and humbled to continue this work.


## Learning Through Variety
**Heineken** | 2019 to 2022

In a fast paced, startup minded analytics environment, I worked on diverse projects to figure out what works in production ML. Some became tools still used today, others taught valuable lessons about real world constraints:

- **Equipment Failure Detection (IoT)** - Explored real time anomaly detection for manufacturing equipment, learned the practical challenges of production ML systems
- **Data Quality Automation** - Built tools for automated validation that are still in use
- **Bottle Design Recommender** - Explored ML applications in product design
- **Warehouse Bin Allocation** - Optimization experiments for space utilization
- **Delivery Route Optimization** - Logistics ML and route planning experiments
- **Churn Prediction Modeling** - Customer retention analytics
- **Workshops & Trainings** - Shared knowledge and best practices across all organizational levels
