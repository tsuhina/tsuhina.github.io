Hi, I'm Tomislav Suhina, PhD — a results-oriented data professional who learned by doing everything. Over 7+ years in industry and 5 in academia, I've gone from experimenting in a startup-minded analytics department to leading teams and building solutions that are still running years later. Based in Amsterdam, I bring experience from both industry and academia across finance, commerce, supply chain, IoT, and logistics.

My journey started in academic research. I earned my PhD in Physical Chemistry from the University of Amsterdam, where I worked on fundamental understanding of molecular motion under confined conditions. I designed molecules, attached them to surfaces, and observed their behavior — using extensive modeling in MATLAB and a wide variety of experimental methodologies. During my doctoral studies, I published in highly-cited international peer-reviewed journals. That scientific rigor and modeling mindset still shapes how I approach data science problems today. My academic experience taught me to be comfortable with accepting the unknown and using scientific methodology to systematically gather the answers required — a skill that translates directly to solving complex business problems.

I'm passionate about learning and delivering real-world solutions that actually work. I prioritize robust approaches over fleeting trends and believe in clear communication with stakeholders. I believe that "simple is better than complex, and complex is better than complicated".

What I'm proud of: I've built projects from scratch (doing everything from model architecture to stakeholder management), led a 15+ person team on one of Heineken's most successful analytics projects with massive business impact, and been brought back as contractor to improve solutions I originally built. That full-circle moment still makes me proud and humbled.

My technical expertise includes data extraction, data validation, model & data drift detection, machine learning, deep learning, LLM agents & RAG solutions, information retrieval, model tracking/monitoring/reproducibility, mapping solutions to business KPIs, A/B testing, software engineering, and the establishment of data pipelines. I have solid understanding of MLOps best practices and experience ranging from quick experiments to mission-critical production systems.

Currently, I work with Heineken on IoT ML projects and logistics optimization solutions, where I deliver effective frameworks and scalable code. I enjoy collaborating with teams to make data accessible and useful, whether it's boosting marketing ROI, streamlining operations, or setting up efficient MLOps pipelines.
