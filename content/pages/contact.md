I'm always interested in discussing new projects and consulting opportunities. As an independent data science consultant based in Amsterdam, I work with clients across Europe (any beyond) delivering solutions that create real business value. I focus on what actually works in production - from quick experiments that teach us something, to systems still running and creating impact years later.
