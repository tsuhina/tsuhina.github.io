<p>As a freelance decision scientist with a PhD and extensive industry experience, I bring experience from learning end to end delivery by doing everything, from model architecture and MLOps to project management and stakeholder management. Some solutions I built are highly impactful and used to this day. I've been brought back as contractor for various improvements on original projects, which makes me proud and humbled. I've also led teams and served as technical lead on high impact initiatives.</p>
<h2>IoT ML Solutions</h2>
<p>Batch analytics and predictive modeling for IoT systems. Built equipment monitoring solutions at Heineken using batch processing and machine learning, currently delivering IoT frameworks. I work with batch anomaly detection and monitoring using Python and Pandas, handle sensor data processing and feature engineering, build predictive maintenance models with Scikit learn and XGBoost, and deploy to production with drift detection using Evidently and MLFlow.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Python, Pandas, Scikit learn, XGBoost, MLFlow, Evidently</p>
<h2>Logistics Optimization</h2>
<p>Supply chain and operations optimization using machine learning. Delivered demand forecasting and cost benefit simulation at Heineken using PyMC and Scikit learn. I handle demand forecasting with PyMC, Prophet, Scikit learn, DARTS, and Nixtla, work on route optimization and resource allocation, build cost benefit simulation and scenario analysis tools, and support raw material planning.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Python, PyMC, Scikit learn, Pandas, Polars, Networkx</p>
<h2>Data Engineering &amp; Big Data</h2>
<p>Large scale data processing and distributed computing. I work with distributed data processing using PySpark on Databricks and self managed clusters, set up data warehousing and analytics with AWS Redshift and Azure Synapse, manage cloud data lakes and storage on AWS S3 and Azure Data Lake, use query engines like AWS Athena and Azure Synapse Analytics, and build ETL pipelines and orchestration with Azure ADF, Databricks workflows, GitHub Actions, and Azure DevOps.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: PySpark, Databricks, AWS (S3, Athena, Redshift), Azure (ADF, Synapse, Data Lake), GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Pandas, Polars</p>
<h2>Entity Deduplication &amp; Record Linkage</h2>
<p>Cleaning up duplicate records that accumulate when data comes from multiple systems. I build deduplication solutions using fuzzy matching, phonetic algorithms, and machine learning for probabilistic record matching. Work covers customer master data, product catalogs, and cross-system integration where the same entity appears differently across sources. These solutions process at scale, handling millions of records efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Python, Pandas, Polars, PySpark, RecordLinkage, Dedupe, Fuzzy matching libraries, Entity resolution</p>
<h2>RAG &amp; LLM Applications</h2>
<p>Building intelligent applications using Retrieval Augmented Generation and Large Language Models. Delivered RAG based knowledge retrieval system at Rabobank (deployed to production). I build knowledge base Q&amp;A systems and chatbots, implement information retrieval and semantic search, handle document analysis and processing, and create LLM optimization and evaluation frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: LangChain, OpenAI, HuggingFace, ChromaDB, FAISS</p>
<h2>Machine Learning Solutions</h2>
<p>Custom ML models for business critical applications. Built retention modeling at Rabobank using XGBoost, financial forecasting at Heineken with Prophet and PyMC (used to this day). I develop customer retention and churn models with XGBoost and Catboost, build classification and regression solutions using Scikit learn, XGBoost, and Catboost, handle time series forecasting with Prophet, PyMC, Scikit learn, DARTS, and Nixtla, and work on causal inference and A/B testing using PyMC and CausalNex.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Python, XGBoost, Catboost, Scikit learn, PyTorch, PyMC, Prophet, CausalNex</p>
<h2>Marketing Analytics &amp; Media Mix Modeling</h2>
<p>Strategic marketing optimization and measurement solutions. Led one of Heineken's most successful analytics projects, Media Mix Modeling that captured significant business value at tens of millions scale in the first year, still actively used for strategic decisions. I specialize in MMM model creation and implementation using Bayesian approaches, marketing attribution and channel effectiveness analysis, ROI measurement and comprehensive reporting, budget optimization recommendations, execution strategy development, and ongoing model maintenance and refinement.</p>
<p><strong>Services Offered</strong>:
- MMM model development and implementation (Bayesian modeling)
- Marketing attribution and channel effectiveness analysis
- ROI measurement and reporting
- Budget optimization recommendations
- Execution strategy development
- Ongoing model maintenance and updates</p>
<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Python, PyMC, Bayesian Modeling, Causal Inference, Marketing Analytics, Statistical Modeling</p>
<h2>MLOps Implementation</h2>
<p>End to end MLOps pipelines for reliable model deployment and maintenance. Built deployment blueprints at Rabobank using Databricks, Docker and MLFlow, established practices at Heineken using Azure ecosystem. I set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and Databricks Asset Bundles, implement model monitoring and drift detection using Evidently and custom solutions, handle data quality validation with Great Expectations and Evidently, manage model tracking and reproducibility through MLFlow, work with containerization and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes, and deploy across cloud platforms including AWS (ECR, SageMaker, S3, Athena, Redshift) and Azure (Container Registry, Azure ML, ADF, Synapse, Databricks).</p>
<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Docker, Kubernetes, MLFlow, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Databricks Asset Bundles, Great Expectations, Evidently, Azure (ADF, Synapse, Databricks, Azure ML), AWS (S3, ECR, SageMaker)</p>
<h2>Data Science Consulting &amp; Collaboration</h2>
<p>Strategic guidance and hands on implementation. I help with data strategy and use case identification, collaborate with cross functional teams, handle stakeholder communication and business alignment, provide technical mentoring and best practices, and deliver workshops and training for both technical and business audiences.</p>
<h2>Python Training &amp; Mentoring</h2>
<p>Workshops and mentoring on Python best practices, data science, and ML engineering. I teach software engineering best practices for data scientists, cover unit/integration testing and code quality, introduce the Python ecosystem and modern tooling, and focus on team enablement and knowledge transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy</strong>: "Simple is better than complex, and complex is better than complicated", the zen of Python guides all my work.</p>
<p>I've built projects from scratch (wearing all the technical and non technical hats), led teams on high impact initiatives, and served as technical lead. Some solutions I built are highly impactful and used to this day. I've been brought back as contractor to work on improvements for them. Whether you need someone to build from scratch, lead a complex delivery, or bridge technical and business needs, I bring that range of experience.</p>
